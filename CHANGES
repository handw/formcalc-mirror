13 Sep 01: Added adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration for 2 -> 3
           (multigauss.F), algorithm can be tuned using the
           NODES_var preprocessor defines in run.F and may be
           significantly faster for some applications, though also
           worse for nasty integrands.
           Added special cases of B1[0, ...] to tools/btensor.m.

30 Aug 01: Largely rewritten the internal FormCalc functions
           for optimization and pre-output ordering:
           OptimizeAbbr, Dependencies, and OnePassOrder,
           yields some 30% in speed.

27 Aug 01: Switched 2 -> 3 code from (fixed-point) multiple Gaussian
           integration to VEGAS, added the adaptive ACM-algorithm
           DCUHRE for checking.
