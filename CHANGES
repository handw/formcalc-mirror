17 Feb 03:

- made DCUHRE the default integrator for 2 -> 3.

- dcuhre.f now included by 2to3.F, obviating the need to explicitly
  compile libdcuhre.a.


12 Feb 03:

- Added OffShell function to take individual particles off shell.

- Removed last remaining CERNlib dependence by adding own routine to
  compute alpha_s.

- Added "--with-cernlib" switch to configure to restore old behaviour
  (e.g. alpha_s should be computed by PDFlib when using the parton
  distribution functions from PDFlib).


28 Jan 03:

- Rearranged much of the Gauss-Kronrod integration in multigauss to
  fix a bug. 

- Fixed up minor problem with allocation of working space in DCUHRE, too.


22 Jan 03: FormCalc 3.2 released, lots of new stuff:

- Completely general and systematic introduction of invariants
  for any number of external legs.

- Added an absolute precision goal to Vegas and Multigauss.

- Improvements in the ScanGraphics package.

- Improvements in ReadData (much faster now).

- 1 -> 2 drivers added.

- Added possibility for parallel execution of FormCalc-generated
  code (compile with -DPARALLEL, see hep-ph/0210220).

- Improvements in the code generation:
  1. Now uses preprocessor macros k(n), e(n), ec(n), and s(n) instead of
     integers to access vectors.
  2. New sumup function improves readability of squared_me.F considerably.
  3. Helicities passed to SquaredME as arrays, not single integers.
  4. sqrtS no longer passed to SquaredME.
  5. Because of the changes in the calling conventions (#3 & #4), the
     subroutine's name has been changed from squared_me to SquaredME
     to alert the user to the new conventions.

- Internal reordering mostly in the FORM part:
  1. Better partial factorization of expressions
  2. Simplification of invariants now done in FORM

- Needs Mathematica 4 or higher now.

- Compiled executables now reside in a single directory, which is named
  by Mathematica's $SystemID, rather than by the shell's $HOSTTYPE,
  e.g. Linux/{ReadForm,ToForm,ToFortran,ReadData}.
  ($HOSTTYPE had led to some complications because tcsh and bash had
  different values for it on some OSs.)

- mssm_ini now uses At, Ab, and Atau (rather than Au and Ad).
  Names have deliberately been chosen different than before because
  Atau must be given in addition to At and Ab, hence this is not
  just a renaming, but there must be at least a statement "Atau = Ab"
  or similar.

- mssm_ini has its own set of SVD and diagonalization routines and is
  hence no longer dependent on LAPACK (libmathlib.a of CERNlib).
  The conventions are now that all mass arrays are sorted into ascending 
  order (MNeu and MCha were in decreasing order so far).  This matches
  the conventions commonly adapted in the literature.


13 Sep 01:

- Added adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration for 2 -> 3 (multigauss.F),
  algorithm can be tuned using the NODES_var preprocessor defines in run.F
  and may be significantly faster for some applications, though also worse
  for nasty integrands.

- Added special cases of B1[0, ...] to tools/btensor.m.


30 Aug 01:

- Largely rewritten the internal FormCalc functions for optimization and
  pre-output ordering: OptimizeAbbr, Dependencies, and OnePassOrder, yields
  some 30% in speed.


27 Aug 01:

- Switched 2 -> 3 code from (fixed-point) multiple Gaussian integration to
  VEGAS, added the adaptive ACM-algorithm DCUHRE for checking.
