This directory contains example calculations with
FeynArts and FormCalc.

The following scattering processes are calculated:

directory | process                        | model(s)
----------+--------------------------------+-----------------
eett      | e^+ e^- -> \bar t t            | SM, SMbgf, MSSM
eeWW      | e^+ e^- -> W^+ W^-             | SM, SMbgf, MSSM
eeHH      | e^+ e^- -> H^+ H^-             | MSSM
AAAA      | \gamma \gamma -> \gamma \gamma | SM, SMbgf
AAtt      | \gamma \gamma -> \bar t t      | SM, SMbgf
WWWW      | W^+ W^- -> W^+ W^-             | SM, SMbgf
ZZZZ      | Z Z -> Z Z                     | SM, SMbgf

where SM is the electroweak Standard Model,
SMbgf the same in the background-field formulation,
and MSSM is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.

The Fortran code for these processes can also be
obtained from www.hep-processes.de.


To execute the demo programs you need

> Mathematica 4 or higher

> FORM 3 or higher
  (available from http://www.nikhef.nl/~form)

> FeynArts 3.1
  (available from http://www.feynarts.de)

> LoopTools 2
  (available from http://www.feynarts.de/looptools)

> GNU make
  (available e.g. from http://www.gnu.org/directory/GNU/make.html)

> a Fortran-77 compiler (g77 if you don't have any other)

> for plotting the results: gnuplot 3.6 or higher
  (available from http://www.gnuplot.info)


The demo programs are invoked as follows:

Change to the respective directory, start Mathematica, and type
"<< XXXX_MODEL.m", where XXXX is the process and MODEL is the model
(sm, smbgf, mssm).

After the program has finished, quit Mathematica and change into the
directory fortran_MODEL.  You may want to look into run.F or model.h
for changing some of the parameters.  Then type
	./configure
	make
to compile the Fortran code.  The resulting executable will be called
run.  For several runs, place the parameters for each in a separate file,
say run1.F, run2.F, ..., and say "make run1", "make run2" etc.

Run "run" with the following parameters:
	./run <pol1> <pol2> <pol3> <pol4> <energyfrom> <energyto>
where the <poli> are the polarization of the external particles.
E.g. to obtain an unpolarized differential cross-section at
Sqrt[s] = 500 GeV use
	./run u u u u 500

IMPORTANT: for the fermionic processes, the amplitudes are calculated
for unpolarized fermions only (the line Hel[_] = 0 is responsible for
this).  Not surprisingly then, invoking "run" with polarizations
different from UUUU won't calculate what you expect: not only won't
it calculate the cross-section for the required polarization, but in
general it won't even give you the correct unpolarized result because
of the different averaging factor.

If you have gnuplot 3.6 (or higher) installed, it is very easy to
plot the results.  Invoke e.g.
	pnuglot run-diff.pol=UUUU.E=00500
pnuglot is a program which writes out a script for running gnuplot and
which exploits the structure of the file name to make the final plot
as "publication ready" as possible.  Even if you're not completely
satisfied with the plot it produces, say you want to modify some
plotting parameter, you have a head start, because all you need to
do is edit this script.  Further notes on plot can be found in the
FormCalc manual.
