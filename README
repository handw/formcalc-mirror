FormCalc 1.2 README file

FormCalc calculates and simplifies one-loop Feynman diagrams. It reads
amplitudes generated with FeynArts and returns the results in a way well
suited for further numerical (or analytical) evaluation.

Internally, FormCalc delegates the hard work (e.g. working out fermionic
traces) to FORM by Jos Vermaseren. Thus FormCalc is merely a driver that
threads the FeynArts amplitudes through FORM in an appropriate way. The
idea is rather simple: FormCalc prepares the symbolic expressions of the
diagrams in an input file for FORM, runs FORM, and retrieves the results.
This interaction is transparent to the user.

FormCalc combines the speed of FORM with the powerful instruction set of
Mathematica and the latter greatly facilitates further processing of the
results. Owing to FORM's speed, FormCalc can process, for example, the
1000-odd one-loop diagrams of elastic W-W scattering in the Standard Model
in about 10 minutes on an ordinary Pentium PC.


Installation notes for the impatient:

- unpack the archive FormCalc12.tar.gz in some directory
  (presumably you did this already or else you wouldn't be reading
  this file)

- run ./compile to compile the ReadForm program needed by FormCalc

For more detailed instructions see the manual in FCLT12Guide.ps.gz.


Enjoy!
