FormCalc 3.2 README file

FormCalc is a Mathematica package for the calculation of tree-level
and one-loop Feynman diagrams. It reads diagrams generated with
FeynArts 3 and returns the results in a way well suited for further
numerical (or analytical) evaluation.

Installation notes for the impatient:

- unpack the archive FormCalc32.tar.gz in some directory
  (presumably you did this already or else you wouldn't be reading
  this file)

- run ./compile to compile the C programs needed by FormCalc

For more detailed instructions see the manual in FC3Guide.ps.gz.

The latest version of FormCalc can be downloaded from
http://www.feynarts.de/formcalc.


Enjoy!
