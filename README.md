# Description

This repository attempts to follow the changes in the FormCalc development using git. We hope that this repository can be useful for people who work
on software packages that rely on FormCalc for the evaluation of Feynman diagrams.

If you want to use FormCalc for your reasearch activities, please do not clone this repository. Instead, download the latest version from the [official site](http://www.feynarts.de/formcalc). Please contact Thomas Hahn (hahn@feynarts.de) for all FormCalc related issues or questions.
